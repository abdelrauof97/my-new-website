        <br>
        <p>I’m Rauof Mohammed, Founder and CEO of RTH. I work exclusively with real estate agents and teams across Canada and the United States, helping them transform standard Real Geeks websites into luxury, high-performing digital platforms.</p>

        <p>At RTH, we don’t use templates or shortcuts. Every Real Geeks site is carefully redesigned to reflect your brand, improve user experience, and maximize lead conversion. Our focus is simple: clean design, strong structure, and SEO optimization that actually works in competitive North American markets.</p>

        <p>The result is a website that doesn’t just look great—it works as a serious business asset, helping agents stand out, attract better leads, and convert more clients.</p>
        <p>Our Promise</p>

        <p>At RTH, we promise to deliver not just software, but a partnership.
        We’ll equip you with the tools and strategies to compete with top companies, while giving you the personalized support you need to thrive in Egypt’s growing real estate market.</p>
